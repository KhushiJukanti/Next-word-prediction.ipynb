**Predictive Text Generation using TensorFlow and Keras RNN**

This repository contains code for training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to predict the next word in a sequence of text. The model is trained on a given dataset and can generate text predictions based on the learned patterns in the data.

## Introduction

Text generation is a popular application of deep learning, where an RNN is trained to predict the next word in a sequence of text. This project demonstrates the implementation of a text generation model using TensorFlow and Keras, allowing you to train your own RNN-based model on your dataset.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy (for data manipulation)
- Pandas (for data handling)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-generation-rnn.git
   cd text-generation-rnn
   ```

2. Install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy pandas
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset or use an existing one.
2. Configure the model parameters and hyperparameters in `config.py`.
3. Preprocess the data (tokenization, padding, etc.).
4. Train the RNN using the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
5. Generate text using the generated model:
   ```bash
   python generate_text.py
   ```

## Dataset

Choose a dataset that is relevant to the type of text you want to generate. The dataset should be in plain text format, where each line represents a sequence of words or sentences.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture used in this project is a simple RNN-based sequence-to-sequence model. You can modify and experiment with more complex architectures like LSTM or GRU layers to improve performance.

## Training

Adjust the hyperparameters and training configuration in `config.py`. Run the training script to train the model on your dataset.

## Text Generation

After training the model, you can use the `generate_text.py` script to generate text based on a seed phrase provided as input.

## Results

Include details about the performance of your trained model. You can discuss metrics like loss during training, sample generated texts, and any challenges you encountered.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests for any improvements or bug fixes.
